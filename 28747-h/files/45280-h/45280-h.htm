      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>ave you heard of
      the wonderful one-hoss-shay,
    </p>
    <p>
      That was built in such a logical way?
    </p>
    <p>
      It ran a hundred years to a day,
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, of a sudden, it&mdash;ah, but stay,
    </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;ll tell you what happened without delay.

      Scaring the parson into fits,
    </p>
    <p>
      Frightening people out of their wits,&mdash;

    <p>
      Have you ever heard of that, I say?

    </p>
    <p>
      Seventeen hundred and fifty-five.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Georgius Secundus</i> was then alive,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Snuffy old drone from the German hive!
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the year when Lisbon-town
    </p>
    <p>
      Saw the earth open and gulp her down,
    </p>
    <p>
      And Braddock&rsquo;s army was done so brown,
    </p>
    <p>
      Left without a scalp to its crown.

      That the Deacon finished the one-hoss-shay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now in building of chaises, I tell you what,
    </p>
    <p>
      There is always <i>somewhere</i> a weakest spot,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      In hub, tire, felloe, in spring or thill,
    </p>
    <p>
      In panel, or crossbar, or floor, or sill,
    </p>
    <p>
      In screw, bolt, thoroughbrace,&mdash;lurking still

    <p>
      Find it somewhere you must and will,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Above or below, or within or without,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And that&rsquo;s the reason, beyond a doubt,
    </p>
    <p>
      A chaise <i>breaks down</i>, but doesn&rsquo;t <i>wear out</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Deacon swore (as Deacons do)
    </p>
    <p>
      With an &ldquo;I dew vum,&rdquo; or an &ldquo;I tell <i>yeou</i>,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would build one shay to beat the taown
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;n&rsquo; the keounty &lsquo;n&rsquo; all the keuntry raoun&rsquo;;

    <p>
      Where he could find the strongest oak,
    </p>
    <p>
      That couldn&rsquo;t be split nor bent nor broke,&mdash;

    <p>
      That was for spokes and floor and sills;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sent for lancewood to make the thills;
    </p>
    <p>
      The crossbars were ash, from the straightest trees;
    </p>
    <p>
      The panels of white-wood, that cuts like cheese,
    </p>
    <p>
      But lasts like iron for things like these;
    </p>
    <p>
      The hubs of logs from the &ldquo;Settler&rsquo;s ellum,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Last of its timber,&mdash;they couldn&rsquo;t sell &lsquo;em,&mdash;

      Their blunt ends frizzled like celery-tips;

      Step and prop-iron, bolt and screw,

      Spring, tire, axle, and linchpin too,

      That was the way he &ldquo;put her through.&rdquo;&mdash;

      Children and grandchildren&mdash;where were they?

      But there stood the stout old one-hoss-shay

    <p>
      Eighteen hundred increased by ten;

      In fact, there&rsquo;s nothing that keeps its youth,

    <p class="indent5">
      In the lap of the breathless tide;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lily hath sisters fresh and fair,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That would lie by the Rose&rsquo;s side;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He would love her better than all the rest,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And he would be fond and true;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Lily unfolded her weary lids,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And looked at the sky so blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember, remember, thou silly one,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      How fast will thy Summer glide,
    </p>
    <p>
      And wilt thou wither a virgin pale,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Or flourish a blooming bride?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O the Rose is old, and thorny, and cold,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And he lives on earth,&rdquo; said she;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Star is fair and he lives in the air.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And he shall my bridegroom be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But what if the stormy cloud should come,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And ruffle the silver sea?
    </p>
    <p>
      Would he turn his eye from the distant sky,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To smile on a thing like thee?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      O no, fair Lily, he will not send
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      One ray from his far-off throne;
    </p>
    <p>
      The winds shall blow and the waves shall flow,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And thou wilt be left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There is not a leaf on the mountain top,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Nor a drop of evening dew,
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor a golden sand on the sparkling shore,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Nor a pearl in the waters blue,
    </p>
    <p>
      That he has not cheered with his fickle smile,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And warmed with his faithless beam,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And will he be true to a pallid flower,

    <p class="indent5">
      That floats on the quiet stream?

    <p>

    <p>
      And bared her breast to the trembling ray

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo;, WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
